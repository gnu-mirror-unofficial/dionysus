<!-- Parent-Version: 1.47 -->

<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the -->
<!--    "$Revision: 1.1 $" from around the revision number, -->
<!--    leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project. -->
<!--    You should be able to do this with search and replace; -->
<!--    making sure that the search is case insensitive and -->
<!--    that the case of the replacement matches the case -->
<!--    of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this -->
<!--    when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil -->
<!--    and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project, -->
<!--    such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate -->
<!--    merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file.  -->

<p>Dionysus is a local machine search engine for universal constants and
parameters of scientific and engineering relevance. If you develop a code
and need any kind of well known constant you do not need to hard code them
anymore. Just use Dionysus and it will do the job for you.</p>

<p>Dionysus is also useful if you need to know some well known constant but you
do not have an Internet connection or you do not want to access to hundreds
web pages to a simple value.</p>

<p>Dionysus has been developed as most carefully as possible and the author
expects the package to be reliable for the plenty of values already included
there.</p>

<p>Anytime you need a value, do not hard code it. Just ask Dionysus and it will
give you the right answer. It is high consuming to look for parameters
values, especially because those values are usually scattered among papers
and websites, some of them being very old and/or impossible to find
anymore.</p>
